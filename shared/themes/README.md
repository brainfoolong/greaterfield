# Theme Development

### How to add a new theme?
* Add a new folder to this themes directory. Mandatory files are `meta.json` and `style.css`. Just look at a existing theme to know what is mandatory for the `meta.json`.
* Add your folder theme name to the json array in the `list.json` of this directory (comma separated)
* Create an issue called "[Theme: xyz] Support ticket", it is the place for everyone to contact you for issues with the theme.

### Rules
It's simple, don't violate the TOS (Terms of service) from the companion or the forums. In generally that means no racism, porn or law breaking stuff. Keep it friendly.
* All your theme files, including images, should not be greater than 400kb. We must keep the extension size as small as possible.
* Do not use any copyright protected material
* Do test your themes pretty well. New versions will only be published to the app stores once a month, +/-. If you have a breaking bug in it, it will remain some weeks.

### Permissions
With creating a theme, as with every other contribution, you add content under the GPL v3 license. Everybody can modify it (but generally will not do it without contacting you). 

### Coding standards and guide lines
* CRLF line endings
* no overhelming doc comments, only where it really provide mandatory information
* 4 space indent
* open curly braces in same line with selectors
* css definiation one per line
* close curly braces in new line
